Replacing blackboard for quizzes


We are all familiar with Blackboard. It is a large piece of slow, unreliable software but we continue to use it because it is effectively the only tool we have for some tasks
This project consists writing a program that will do Blackboard quiz setting and administration more effectively than Blackboard does. The program should allow academics to set questions with answers and student feedback for wrong answers and associated a list of students (including photographs) who are to answer them. It should then offer the quiz to the students at a fixed time and on specific machines, record their answers and output results in a usable form for both the academic and the student. Ideally it should show a photograph of the student taking the quiz on their screen while they are sitting the test to avoid the need to check Cards.
The best approach, initially, would be to start with some simple form of question like true/false and get that working and then move on to more complicated formats which may require human marking. For human marked work the marking should automatically be anonymous (unlike Blackboard) and allow partial marks. Where a mark is given by the academic for a particular answer all students who submitted and identical answer should get the same mark without any further reference to the academic (unlike Blackboard).
Both efficiency and security are obviously of fundamental importance here so quite a lot of thought will have to go into both aspects although, when it comes to efficiency, Blackboard is quite an easy target to beat.
