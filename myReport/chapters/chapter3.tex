\chapter{System Requirements Analysis}

\section{Introduction}

The development of a comprehensive quiz management system requires a thorough analysis of functional and non-functional requirements to ensure the platform meets the diverse needs of academic institutions. This chapter presents a detailed requirements analysis based on the implemented system, covering user roles, core functionalities, security considerations, and performance requirements. The analysis draws from stakeholder needs in educational environments and best practices in web application development.

\section{Requirements of the System}

\end{itemize}

The requirements prioritization methodology draws from two key sources: recent empirical research by Vijayakumar et al. (2024) on MoSCoW effectiveness in software development,
 and the structured approach demonstrated in Osakue's (2025) dissertation on functional programming libraries. 
 Vijayakumar's research, involving 172 development team members, revealed that while MoSCoW provides a clear framework for requirement categorization, i
 ts practical application presents specific challenges. The study documented a 72.67\% completion rate for prioritization tasks, 
 with participants taking an average of 3 minutes per requirement decision. These metrics informed the time allocation and documentation approach for this project's requirement analysis phase.

Osakue's dissertation demonstrated how MoSCoW prioritization can effectively categorize functional requirements in library development, 
particularly when dealing with technical constraints and component hierarchies. 
Building on this framework, the requirements analysis for this quiz application adopts a similar tabular structure, organizing features into must-have core functionality, should-have important enhancements, could-have desirable additions, and won't-have excluded features. 
The sentiment analysis from Vijayakumar's study, which showed 58.1\% negative sentiment using VADER analysis primarily due to implementation confusion, prompted the inclusion of explicit categorization criteria and regular validation cycles in the prioritization process.


% They have been prioritised using the MoSCoW framework, categorising each as Must-
Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, or Wonâ€™t-Have. This prioritisation approach ensures de-
velopment resources are allocated appropriately. The MoSCoW framework is given

\hline
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
Must Have & The requirements must be met on time and contain the specifications that are essential to the project's success.  If these components were not implemented, the project would fail or have a significant negative impact on stakeholders.  \\

\hline
Should Have & Important requirements that are desirable but not essential for the project's immediate success.  These enhance the product's overall worth and should be included after all necessary characteristics have been satisfied. \\

\hline
Could Have & Extra criteria that enhance the product but are not required for its primary functions. These things may be completed if time and finances permit, but they are not prioritized over must-have or should-have items.  \\


\hline
Won't Have & Needs that are expressly excluded from the current scope of the project. These are either deferred to subsequent iterations or considered low priority for the current development cycle.\\
